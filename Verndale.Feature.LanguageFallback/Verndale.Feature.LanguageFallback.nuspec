	<description>

Verndale Helix Catalog is a collection of utilities for the Sitecore .NET CMS.
The Feature.LanguageFallback library contains a number of user efficiency enhancements for Sitecore's Language Fallback feature.

Language Fallback Report:
Allows you to see which Items are falling back to which languages.


Language Migration Tool:
Allows you to migrate content from one database/language to another.


Culture Resolver HttpRequest Pipeline Processor:
HttpRequestBegin Pipeline processor that ensures that your System CurrentCulture matches your Sitecore Language.


Default Site Language Resolver Pipeline Processor:
HttpRequestBegin Pipeline processor that changes Sitecore's default language resolution strategy such that URLs that do not contain
a language flag will be configured to serve the site's default language.


AlternateLanguageLinksController:
Will populate your HTML Header with canonical (local) links for the current Item in all languages supported by the context site.

Language Fallback Commands:
Installed in the Ribbon area of the Content Editor:
* Create Version in All Languages - ensures an Item has a Version in each of it's Site's supported languages.
* Enable/Disable Enforce Version Presence - turns this feature on or off for the selected Template or Templates.
* Enable/Disable Language Fallback - turns this feature on or off for the selected Template or Templates.
* Enable/Disable Field Level Fallback - turns this feature on or off for the selected Template fields.


This library requires the installation of a Sitecore Package (included). This should happen automatically when you build and deploy your project.
